# VisionBasedRobotManipulator
Collecting demonstrations and perform policy learning for an inexpensive, vision driven robot.

The recommended way to organize this code is as follows:

```
top directory
    \data
        \demos
            <<< this is where the demonstrations go
    \github
        \VisionBasedDataManipulator
            <<< this git checkout
    \venv
        .venv
            <<< this is where the Python 3.10 environment goes
```
