# What is this

The ```sensorprocessing''' package contains code for processing the robots sensor input. As we are working with vision driven robots, most of this code is vision code. However, the code might also include proprioception code, or potentially other type of information.

In the big picture, the code in this package takes as input sensory data (pictures etc.) and outputs an __encoding vector z__.
